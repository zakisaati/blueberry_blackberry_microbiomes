## Guide
- The [QIIME2](./QIIME2/) folder is divided into two sub-folders:
  - The [Visualizers](./QIIME2/Visualizers/) folder contains QIIME2 .qzv files. These files are interactive graphs that can be viewed with [Qiime2 - view] (https://view.qiime2.org/)
  - The [Artifacts](./QIIME2/Artifacts/) folder contains QIIME2 .qza files that can be used to reproduce our data and to make extra analyses.
