## Guide
- The [QIIME2](./QIIME2/) folder is divided into two sub-folders:
  - The [Visualizers](./QIIME2/Visualizers/) folder contains QIIME2 .qzv files. These files are interactive graphs that can be viewed with [Qiime2 - view] (https://view.qiime2.org/)
  - The [Artifacts](./QIIME2/Artifacts/) folder contains QIIME2 .qza files that can be used to reproduce our data and to make extra analyses.
  
- The raw data can be downloaded from the SRA, under the following BioProject: ...... and also from the [Raw data](./Raw_data/) folder.
- The [Source data](./Source_data/) folder contains tables and matrixes used to generate boxplots and barplots.
